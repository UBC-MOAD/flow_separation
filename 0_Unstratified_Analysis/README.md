* ##[jan21.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/flow_separation/raw/tip/0_Unstratified_Analysis/jan21.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook compares the NONHYDROSTATIC runs of flow-over-cylinder, and additionally looks at the separation point as a function of time.  

* ##[feb2.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/flow_separation/raw/tip/0_Unstratified_Analysis/feb2.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook compares $Re=25$ simulations for various resolutions.  

* ##[domain_length_compare.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/flow_separation/raw/tip/0_Unstratified_Analysis/domain_length_compare.ipynb)  
    
    Compare half-cylinder runs with and without wake  

* ##[jan28.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/flow_separation/raw/tip/0_Unstratified_Analysis/jan28.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook compares the calculated separation point as a function of grid resolution.  

* ##[gen_irregular_grid_ICs.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/flow_separation/raw/tip/0_Unstratified_Analysis/gen_irregular_grid_ICs.ipynb)  
    
    Generate an irregular grid (linearly interpolated) for the flow-over half cylinder cases.
