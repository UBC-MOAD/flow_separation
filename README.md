# README #

This repository contains iPython Notebooks used to investigate flow separation in the MITgcm.

## Directories ##

### 0_Unstratified_Analysis ###

Contains several iPython notebooks looking at homogeneous flow around a half-cylinder.

### 1_Stratified_Analysis ###

Contains three iPython notebooks looking at stratified flow around a half-cylinder. Still in early stages of development.

### 2_Old_Notebooks ###

Contains several iPython notebooks looking at homogeneous flow around a half-cylinder. Mostly exploratory, before the final domain/boundary conditions/etc. were decided.
