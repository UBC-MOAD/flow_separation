* ##[compare_simulations.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/flow_separation/raw/tip/notebooks_2D_runs/compare_simulations.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook compares several 2D flow separation runs.  

* ##[compare_tank_exp.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/flow_separation/raw/tip/notebooks_2D_runs/compare_tank_exp.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook compares results from 2009/2010 MITgcm tank-scale output to current MITgcm output.  

* ##[cylinder_comp_domain_size.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/flow_separation/raw/tip/notebooks_2D_runs/cylinder_comp_domain_size.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook compares the standard 40cm wide by 10cm tall tank domain to the 80cm wide by 10cm tall tank domain. The resolution is currently low, but if there are discrepancies in data, the resolutions will be increased.  

* ##[cylinder_resolution_compare.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/flow_separation/raw/tip/notebooks_2D_runs/cylinder_resolution_compare.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook compares flow-over cylinder runs at different resolutions. Compares separation point as a function of time.  

* ##[fd_derivation.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/flow_separation/raw/tip/notebooks_2D_runs/fd_derivation.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook derives the finite difference algorithm needed to approximate the time-dependent boundary layer equations.  

* ##[gen_flow_over_cylinder_case.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/flow_separation/raw/tip/notebooks_2D_runs/gen_flow_over_cylinder_case.ipynb)  
    
* ##[gen_flow_sep_files.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/flow_separation/raw/tip/notebooks_2D_runs/gen_flow_sep_files.ipynb)  
    
    This ipynb creates the 2D topography, stratification, and boundary condition files for looking at Flow Separation in the MITgcm.  

* ##[jan16.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/flow_separation/raw/tip/notebooks_2D_runs/jan16.ipynb)  
    
    This code compares the results of the free-slip and no-slip-over-cylinder-runs.  

* ##[process_data.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/flow_separation/raw/tip/notebooks_2D_runs/process_data.ipynb)  
    
    This script takes in a directory with a flow separation run and generates plots and figures.  

* ##[summary.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/flow_separation/raw/tip/notebooks_2D_runs/summary.ipynb)  
    
    The state of the flow-over cylinder problem in the MITgcm.  

* ##[view_flow_over_cylinder.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/flow_separation/raw/tip/notebooks_2D_runs/view_flow_over_cylinder.ipynb)
