* ##[summary.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/flow_separation/raw/tip/notebooks_2D_runs/summary.ipynb)  
    
    The state of the flow-over cylinder problem in the MITgcm.  

* ##[cylinder_resolution_compare.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/flow_separation/raw/tip/notebooks_2D_runs/cylinder_resolution_compare.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook compares flow-over cylinder runs at different resolutions. Compares separation point as a function of time.  

* ##[compare_simulations.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/flow_separation/raw/tip/notebooks_2D_runs/compare_simulations.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook compares several 2D flow separation runs.  

* ##[Untitled0.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/flow_separation/raw/tip/notebooks_2D_runs/Untitled0.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook compares the impulsively started run to the run seeded with the potential flow field.  

* ##[compare_tank_exp.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/flow_separation/raw/tip/notebooks_2D_runs/compare_tank_exp.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook compares results from 2009/2010 MITgcm tank-scale output to current MITgcm output.  

* ##[gen_flow_over_cylinder_case.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/flow_separation/raw/tip/notebooks_2D_runs/gen_flow_over_cylinder_case.ipynb)  
    
* ##[view_flow_over_cylinder.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/flow_separation/raw/tip/notebooks_2D_runs/view_flow_over_cylinder.ipynb)  
    
* ##[process_data.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/flow_separation/raw/tip/notebooks_2D_runs/process_data.ipynb)  
    
    This script takes in a directory with a flow separation run and generates plots and figures.  

* ##[gen_flow_sep_files.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/flow_separation/raw/tip/notebooks_2D_runs/gen_flow_sep_files.ipynb)  
    
    This ipynb creates the 2D topography, stratification, and boundary condition files for looking at Flow Separation in the MITgcm.  

* ##[cylinder_comp_domain_size.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/flow_separation/raw/tip/notebooks_2D_runs/cylinder_comp_domain_size.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook compares the standard 40cm wide by 10cm tall tank domain to the 80cm wide by 10cm tall tank domain. The resolution is currently low, but if there are discrepancies in data, the resolutions will be increased.  

* ##[jan16.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/canyonsubc/flow_separation/raw/tip/notebooks_2D_runs/jan16.ipynb)  
    
    This code compares the results of the free-slip and no-slip-over-cylinder-runs.
